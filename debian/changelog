fail2ban (0.8.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Debian packaging switched from git+dpatch into pure git way via
    feature-branches. That revealed the true amount of accumulated patching

  * NF: new filter for 'refused connect' (closes: #451093). Thanks Guido

fail2ban (0.7.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Yaroslav Halchenko <debian@onerussian.com>  Thu, 18 Jan 2007 10:35:36 -0500

fail2ban (0.7.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, which incorporates fixes introduced in 3~pre
    non-released versions (which were suggested to the users to overcome
    problems reported in bug reports). In particular attention should be paid
    to upstream changelog entries
    - Several "failregex" and "ignoreregex" are now accepted.
      Creation of rules should be easier now.
      This is an alternative solution to 'multiple <HOST>' entries fix,
      which is not applied to this shipped version - pay caution if upgrading
      from 0.7.5-3~pre?
    - Allow comma in action options. The value of the option must
      be escaped with " or '.
      That allowed to implement requested ability to ban multiple ports
      at once (See 373592). README.Debian and jail.conf adjusted to reflect
      possible use of iptables-mport
    - Now Fail2ban goes in /usr/share/fail2ban instead of
      /usr/lib/fail2ban. This is more compliant with FHS.
      Patch 00_share_insteadof_lib no longer applied
  * Refactored installed by debian package jail.conf:
    - Added option banaction which is to incorporate banning agent
      (usually some flavor of iptables rule), which can then be easily
      overriden globally or per section
    - Multiple actions are defined as action_* to serve as shortcuts
  * Initd script was modified to inform about present socket file which
    would forbid fail2ban-server from starting
  * Adjusted default log file for postfix to be /var/log/mail.log
    (Closes: #404921)

fail2ban (0.7.5-3~pre6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fail2ban now bans vsftpd logins (corrected logfile path and failregex)
    (Closes: #404060)
  * Made fail2ban-server tollerate multiple <HOST> entries in failregex
  * Moved call to dh_pycentral before dh_installinit
  * Removed unnecessary call of dh_shlibdeps
  * Added filter ssh-ddos to fight DDOS attacks. Must be used with caution
    if there is a possibility of valid clients accessing through
    unreliable connection or faulty firewall (Closes: #404487)
  * Not applying patch any more for rigid python2.4 - it is default now in
    sid/etch
  * Moving waiting loop for fail2ban-server to stop under do_stop
    function, so it gets invoked by both 'restart' and 'stop' commands
  * do_status action of init script is now using 'fail2ban-client ping'
    instead of '... status' since we don't really use returned status
    information, besides the return error code

  * NEWS.Debian confusions - the latest NEWS entry and postinst message were
    rephrased (Closes: #402350)
  * Added mail-whois-lines action, which emails log lines containing abuser
    IP. Those lines are often required for proper abuse reports sent to the
    Internet providers.  Forwarding of such received emails to the email
    addresses of abuse departments present in the output of whois is a
    tentative solution for semi-automatic abuse reporting (Closes: #358810)

    filter definitions

 -- Yaroslav Halchenko <debian@onerussian.com>  Wed, 10 May 2006 11:45:57 -0400

fail2ban (0.6.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Assigned maxreinits to 1000 to be reasonable since otherwise logfile grows
    indefinetly if there is a real problem on the system (closes: #359218)
  * Adjusted debian/{copyright,watch}
  * New version of init.d script (Thanks to Aaron Isotton) (closes: #364278)

 -- Yaroslav Halchenko <debian@onerussian.com>  Mon, 27 Mar 2006 12:55:39 -0500

 -- Yaroslav Halchenko <debian@onerussian.com>  Fri,  3 Mar 2006 16:32:38 -0500

fail2ban (0.6.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed Apache section: changed filepath to point at error.log, thus I had
    to revert timeregex and timepattern to user RFC 2822 format (closes:
    #354346)

 -- Yaroslav Halchenko <debian@onerussian.com>  Sat, 25 Feb 2006 19:56:46 -0500

fail2ban (0.6.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modifications in README.Debian to reflect a "finding" on
    not-AllowedUsers banning which requires default Debian configuration
    of "ChallengeResponseAuthentication no" and "PasswordAuthentication
    yes"
  * Fixed Apache timeregex and timepattern to confirm
    the fomat of time stamp used in Debian's acccess.log (error.log uses
    RFC 2822 format)
  * Added section ApacheAttacks to specify some common patterns of attacks on
    a webserver (awstats.pl as a try). This section stays split from Apache
    since it is of different nature and might be not appropriate for some
    users
  * Forced owner/permissions of log file to be root:adm/640 in postinst and
    logrotate (closes: #352053)

 -- Yaroslav Halchenko <debian@onerussian.com>  Mon, 16 Jan 2006 04:05:19 -0500

fail2ban (0.6.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * ignoreip is now empty by default (closes: #347766)
  * increased verbosity in verbose=2 mode: now prints options accepted
    from the config file
  * to make fail2ban.conf more compact, thus to improve its readability,
    fail2ban.conf was converted to use "interpolations" provided by
    ConfigParser class. fw{start,end,{,un}ban} options were moved into
    DEFAULT section and required options (port, protocol) were added

 -- Yaroslav Halchenko <debian@onerussian.com>  Thu, 12 Jan 2006 18:32:14 -0500

fail2ban (0.6.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * fail2ban path is inserted first in the list to avoid a conflict with
    existing elsewhere modules with the same names. (Thanks for report and
    patch to Nick Craig-Wood) (closes: #343821) 

 -- Yaroslav Halchenko <debian@onerussian.com>  Mon, 19 Dec 2005 17:44:58 +0200

fail2ban (0.6.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merged with the latest stable upstream release. That incure some
    changes for the Debian configuration of the package to be more
    upstream-like. Visible one is: subject in the sent email includes
    section outside of "[Fail2Ban]"
  * Updated README.Debian to answer possible question regarding effective
    bantime starting moment

 -- Yaroslav Halchenko <debian@onerussian.com>  Sun, 20 Nov 2005 14:56:41 -0500

fail2ban (0.5.4-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the order of ssh and apache rules to avoid possible race
    condition (Thanks to Jefferson Cowart for the bug report) (closes:
    #339133)

 -- Yaroslav Halchenko <debian@onerussian.com>  Mon, 14 Nov 2005 23:44:45 -0500

fail2ban (0.5.4-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed init.d script so it doesn't return non-0 status if fail2ban is not
    running. That fixes issues with purging the package and leaving garbage in
    /usr/share/fail2ban (Thanx to Justin Pryzby for the insight)
    (closes: #337223)

 -- Yaroslav Halchenko <debian@onerussian.com>  Thu,  3 Nov 2005 17:05:20 -0500

fail2ban (0.5.4-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added config option MAIL.localtime (closes: #336449)

 -- Yaroslav Halchenko <debian@onerussian.com>  Mon, 31 Oct 2005 16:53:19 -0500

fail2ban (0.5.4-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adjusted init.d script so it is resistant to delayed shutdowns of
    fail2ban and in general more stable

 -- Yaroslav Halchenko <debian@onerussian.com>  Thu, 20 Oct 2005 21:22:03 -0400

fail2ban (0.5.4-6.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed typos (thanx to Ross Boylan).
  * Robust startup: if iptables module gets fully initialized after
    startup of fail2ban, fail2ban will do "maxreinit" attempts to
    initialize its own firewall. It will sleep between attempts for
    "polltime" number of seconds (closes: #334272).
  * To overcome possible conflict with other firewall solutions and as a
    secondary solution for the bug 334272, fail2ban startup is moved
    during bootup to the latest (S99) sequenece position. That should not
    cause any discomfort I believe.

 -- Yaroslav Halchenko <debian@onerussian.com>  Tue, 18 Oct 2005 15:54:38 -0400

fail2ban (0.5.4-5.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a notification regarding the importance of 0.5.4-5 change of
    failregex in the config file.
  * Adjusted address to FSF.
  * Adjusted failregex for SSH so it bans "Illegal user" entries as well, and
    restricted full failregex more to include ":" at the beginning, because
    otherwise it might not be sufficient and would revive bug 330827 (closes:
    #333056).
  * Adjusted failregex for SSH to accommodate recent changes in logging of
    SSH: Illegal -> Invalid. Should match both now.
  * Fixed a problem of raise AttributeError exception reported as a side
    effect of crash during parsing of the config file.
  * Introduced fwcheck option to verify consistency of the
    chains. Implemented automatic restart of fail2ban main function in
    case check of fwban or fwunban command failed (closes: #329163, #331695).
    (Introduced patch was further adjusted by upstream author).
  * Added -f command line parameter for [findtime].
  * Fixed the issue of not respecting command line parameters for parameters
    within sections.
  * Added -e command line parameter to provide enabled sections from command
    line.
  * Added a cleanup of firewall rules on emergency shutdown when unknown
    exception is catched.
  * Fail2ban should not crash now if a wrong file name is specified in
    config.

 -- Yaroslav Halchenko <debian@onerussian.com>  Mon,  3 Oct 2005 22:26:28 -1000

fail2ban (0.5.4-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made failregex'es more specific to don't allow usernames to be used as a
    tool for denial of service attacks. Config files (or at least
    failregex'es) must be updated from this package, otherwise the security
    breach would remain open and only warning gets issued (closes: #330827)

 -- Yaroslav Halchenko <debian@onerussian.com>  Sat,  1 Oct 2005 02:42:23 -1000

fail2ban (0.5.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * On a request from Calum Mackay added reporting of the enabled sections

 -- Yaroslav Halchenko <debian@onerussian.com>  Thu, 29 Sep 2005 11:20:43 -1000

fail2ban (0.5.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Resolved the mystery of debug mode in which commands are not really
    executed: added verbose option to config file, removed -v from
    /etc/default/fail2ban, reordered code a bit so that log targets are
    setup right after background and then only loglevel (verbose,debug) is
    processed, so the warning could be seen in the logs

 -- Yaroslav Halchenko <debian@onerussian.com>  Thu, 29 Sep 2005 00:20:43 -1000

fail2ban (0.5.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now exporting PATH explicitely in init.d/fail2ban script, to avoid
    problems finding iptables in the cases when PATH was not exported outside
    (cfengine, broken shell environment) (closes: #329304)
  * Removed -b from start-stop-daemon because fail2ban detahes on its own
  * Added @localhost to MAIL:from and MAIL:to in fail2ban.conf and placed
    a note to README.Debian regarding necessity to specify full email
    address in MAIL:from (closes: #329722)
  * Added a keyword <section> in parsing of the subject and the body of an
    email sent out by fail2ban (closes: #330311)
